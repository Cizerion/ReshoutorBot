# Re:Shout!Or?

IMPORTANT: Before using bot, please, read "/help" carefully!

Hello everyone!

I decided to create simple Telegram bot (using API Telegram) which can 
help to decide what to do. He supports 3 types of answers: "Yes", "No" and 
"Dont know/Undetermined". All answers generates randomly.

Re:Shout!Or? supports next commands in chat:
/start - say "Hi" to the bot and read his introduction speach;
/help - use it to call help;
/q [your question] - ask him  your question in chat using this comand;
/author - secret command that shows who made this bot; 

Also Re:Shout!Or? supports inline mode which you can access via 
"@reshoutor_bot [your question]" command in text field.

Currently supports only russian language.
